Here's a changelog highlighting the changes between the two versions of the Python code you provided:

**Changes:**

1. **Image File Paths:**
    - In the first version, image file paths are provided using absolute paths.
    - In the second version, image file paths are provided using relative paths with backslashes (`..\`).

2. **Function Documentation:**
    - In the second version, function documentation (docstrings) has been added for the `choose_image()` and `choose_output_destination()` functions.

3. **Multiple Image Selection:**
    - In the second version, the `choose_image()` function now allows selecting multiple image files at once using the `askopenfilenames` method. The selected file paths are joined with semicolons in the entry field.

4. **Progress Bar:**
    - The second version introduces the `tqdm` library to create a progress bar for the `resize_multiple_images_with_progress()` function.

5. **Multiple Image Resizing:**
    - In the second version, the `resize_multiple_images_with_progress()` function has been introduced to resize multiple selected images with progress tracking.

6. **Dimensions and Format:**
    - In the second version, the predefined dimensions and format choices have been updated.

7. **Custom Dimension Validation:**
    - In the second version, the `resize_multiple_images_with_progress()` function includes validation to ensure that custom width and height inputs are numeric.

8. **Watermark Position:**
    - In the first version, the watermark label is placed at the bottom-right corner.
    - In the second version, the watermark label is placed at the bottom-right corner using the `pack()` method and the `anchor` attribute.

9. **Start GUI Event Loop:**
    - Both versions include the code to start the GUI event loop using the `window.mainloop()` statement.
